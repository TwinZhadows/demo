This is an experiment on creating backend API using Java Spring Boot, PosgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka.
The project mainly focuses on user services allowing the users to:
- Create a new account
- Activate a newly created account by sending activation email
- Resend activation email if expired
- Login 
- Update profile
- Refresh token
- Subscribe and send messages to chat topic
